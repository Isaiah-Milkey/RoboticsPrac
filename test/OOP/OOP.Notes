OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING

Object in Java:  can be abstract, or concrete
ex: shape/ or open data file

Class: blueprint/ layout for an object
"instance of a class" - basically an object 
-variables for each time you make an object instance



Constructor: tells how to create an object of a class
Ex: public Person(String name, int age, double weight, double height) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
    this.weight = weight;
    this.height = height;

    //{"this" = proves the instance of the class} 

}

Object of a class Ex:
//Person mitch = new Person("Mitch", 17, 130, 60);
1. name of ckass
2. name of object
3. add new/ instance of class

ex: 
Scanner = gradeScanner = new Scanner (System.in);

How to call method      Q. Do methods carry the variables from objects?
Ex:
mitch.maximumheartrate();
